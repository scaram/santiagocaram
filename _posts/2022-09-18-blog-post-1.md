Thanks to a dear friend of mine, Flaminio Grimaldi, I got the tools and language to understand the functioning of a website. 
He has also written a simple and useful guide for those who are not familiar with programming (a.k. layman's). I strongly recommend to visit his website: [https://www.flaminiogrimaldi.it/](https://www.flaminiogrimaldi.it/ "https://www.flaminiogrimaldi.it/")
