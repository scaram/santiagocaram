<p style="text-align: justify;">Welcome! I am an applied economist. I earned my Ph.D in Economics, Management and Statistics from <a title="UNIME in Italy" href="https://www.unime.it/it">UNIME in Italy</a>. Before that I received a M.A in Economics from <a title="UCEMA" href="https://ucema.edu.ar/posgrado/maestria-en-economia">UCEMA</a> and a B.S in Economics from <a title="UNLP in Argentina" href="https://www.depeco.econo.unlp.edu.ar/wp/">UNLP in Argentina</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My main research fields are Development Economics, Applied Economics and Labour Economics. I am particularly interested on the developmental effects of public policies such as infrastructure expenditures, preferential trade agreements and environmental policies over labour markets.</p>
