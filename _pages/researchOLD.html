<p><br /><strong>Abstract</strong>:</p>
<p>In light of the current U.S business slowdown in a context where ideas are difficult to find and "superstar firms" concentrate almost all knowledge and technology, two questions arise:&nbsp;<br />Can State incentives monetary (R&amp;D tax-credits) and non-monetary (the diffusion of past public policies) coupled with infrastructure investments (public and private) boost job creation rates among industries?&nbsp;<br />If so, in which sectors these effects will be larger? Would it be any effect on wages? This paper examines the effectiveness of public policies over U.S labour markets.&nbsp;<br />To this end, I propose a simple regional model in which workers have some kind of mobility and firms make use of both types of incentives.&nbsp;<br />Then, I identify some stylized facts from the U.S business slowdown (e.g., higher knowledge gap and lower competition between public firms) in high-tech sectors during the 1990-2015 period.&nbsp;<br />I focus on these group of firms because regional economies are expected to be benefited more from the increasing value share generated as well as different forms of agglomeration economies and thick market externalities.&nbsp;<br />I find that both types of incentives coupled with private non-residential expenditures have a positive business "enabler" entrepreneurship effect on employment rates in top value-added sectors while highway expenditures&nbsp;<br />display a negative "disabler" effect but only restricted to sectors with lower value share.&nbsp;<br />Interestingly, generous State subsidies and R&amp;D user cost are positively associated to higher job creation rates in bottom rather than top value-added sectors.&nbsp;<br />When spatial effects are accounted for, I find positive and significant spillover effects of R&amp;D tax-credits in both groups provided that efficiency gains are pass-through to more patents.&nbsp;<br />Likewise, in the case of wages the same trend from employment are observed. That is the median worker in lower value-added sectors benefits more from these public policies as his/her salary is higher compared to workers in top value-added sectors.&nbsp;<br />Evidently, larger amounts of knowledge in sectors with increasing value shares do not necessarily imply more jobs and/or better salaries.&nbsp;<br />Therefore, the findings of this paper are an important departure from the "beggar the neighbour effect" and the effectiveness of traditional public policies over labour markets.
