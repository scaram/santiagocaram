## Better safe than sorry? Infrastructure, State Incentives and Innovation across U.S states. (Job Market Paper) 
[PDF File](https://scaram.github.io/santiagocaram/files/jmp_sc.pdf "PDF Files")


### Abstract:
------------
<p style="text-align: justify;">This paper examines the effects of infrastructure expenditures and State incentives over regional labour markets for the U.S. economy.&nbsp;To this end, I propose a simple model in which workers have some kind of mobility and firms make use of two types of incentives: monetary (R&D tax credits) and non-monetary (diffusion of past public policies).&nbsp;Then, I identify some stylized facts from the U.S business slowdown (e.g., higher knowledge gap and lower competition between public firms) in high-tech sectors during the 1990-2015 period.&nbsp;I focus on these group of firms because regional economies are expected to be benefited more from the increasing value share generated as well as different forms of agglomeration economies and thick market externalities.&nbsp;I find that R&amp;D tax credits and the diffusion of past policies coupled with private non-residential expenditures have a positive business "enabler" entrepreneurship effect on employment rates in top value-added sectors while highway expenditures display a negative "disabler" effect but only restricted to sectors with lower value share.&nbsp;Interestingly, generous State subsidies and R&amp;D user cost gains are positively associated to higher job creation rates in bottom rather than top value-added sectors.&nbsp;When spatial effects are accounted for, I find positive and significant spillover effects of R&amp;D tax-credits in both groups provided that efficiency gains are pass-through to more patents.&nbsp;Likewise, in the case of wages the same trend from employment are observed. That is the median worker in lower value-added sectors benefits more from these public policies as his/her salary is higher compared to workers in top value-added sectors.&nbsp;Evidently, larger amounts of knowledge in sectors with increasing value shares do not necessarily imply more jobs and/or better salaries. Therefore, the findings of this paper are an important departure from the "beggar the neighbour effect" and the effectiveness of traditional public policies over labour markets.</p>

## Public-Private Investments, Financial Support and Growth

### Abstract:
------------
<p style="text-align: justify;">Large infrastructure projects (e.g., a bridge) require substantial fiscal resources. Literature has documented the macroeconomic stability channel as the main driver of Public-Private-Partnerships (PPI) at a cross-country level. However, legal origin effects of new PPI with multilateral financial support (MFS) over growth have not been considered. Using a panel data of 36 developed and developing countries for the 1990-2015 period. I find that "animal spirits" are inversely related to financial security in terms of contract repudiation for French origin laws. Therefore, countries that engage on PPP with MFS have on average higher GDP per capita and productivity levels compared to those who do not embrace&nbsp;on these programs other things being equal.&nbsp;</p>

## Welfare Effects of Exchange Rate Controls: The case of Argentina

### Abstract:
------------
<p style="text-align: justify;">Along history, Argentina's multiple exchange rate system has created serious economic distortions. The 2011-15 episode does not differ from previous experiences. For instance, private external assets grew 37.7% with respect to 2010 as well as dollarized deposits (75% on average) during 2011-16 while the Black Market Premium reached a peak of 60.7% in 2013. This paper takes a deep step and assess the effects of exchange rate controls in Argentina using a partial equilibrium model. First, using Zellner's Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) structural approach, I calculate Argentina main import-price elasticities. Second, I estimate the natural rate of exchange rate of economy (NATREX) to assess the net welfare effects between the "official" and the "unified market". Results indicate that the price of the official exchange should have been around 4.4 and 12 ARS units per U.S. dollar. Likewise, a higher volume of capital imports suggests that trade openess should also have been higher. Overall, the total efficiency loss caused by exchange rate regulations was on average 4% of GDP during 2011-15 period.</p>
